title: Java并发编程之：Java内存模型
---


The Java memory model specifies how the Java virtual machine works with the computer's memory (RAM). The Java virtual machine is a model of a whole computer so this model naturally includes a memory model - AKA the Java memory model.

It is very important to understand the Java memory model if you want to design correctly behaving concurrent programs. The Java memory model specifies how and when different threads can see values written to shared variables by other threads, and how to synchronize access to shared variables when necessary.

The original Java memory model was insufficient, so the Java memory model was revised in Java 1.5. This version of the Java memory model is still in use in Java 8.

前言：Java内存模型详细说明了Java虚拟机(以下将使用JVM这个术语)是如何与计算机的内存(RAM)进行交互的。JVM是一个完整计算机的模型，所以该模型也包含了内存模块，也就是我们熟知的Java内存模型。

想要设计出符合预期的并发程序，了解Java的内存模型是非常重要的。Java内存模型详细描述了不同的线程如何以及何时可以看见被其他线程写入的共享变量，以及在需要时如何同步使用共享变量。

Java内存模型在一开始是不够完善的，不过它在Java 1.5中被改进了。Java8依然在使用这一改进版本的内存模型。

# 一、一窥Java内存模型的内部

The Java memory model used internally in the JVM divides memory between thread stacks and the heap. This diagram illustrates the Java memory model from a logic perspective:

JVM中的Java内存模型将内存分为线程栈(thread stacks)和堆(heap)。下图从逻辑角度演示了Java的内存模型：

Each thread running in the Java virtual machine has its own thread stack. The thread stack contains information about what methods the thread has called to reach the current point of execution. I will refer to this as the "call stack". As the thread executes its code, the call stack changes.

The thread stack also contains all local variables for each method being executed (all methods on the call stack). A thread can only access it's own thread stack. Local variables created by a thread are invisible to all other threads than the thread who created it. Even if two threads are executing the exact same code, the two threads will still create the local variables of that code in each their own thread stack. Thus, each thread has its own version of each local variable.

All local variables of primitive types ( boolean, byte, short, char, int, long, float, double) are fully stored on the thread stack and are thus not visible to other threads. One thread may pass a copy of a pritimive variable to another thread, but it cannot share the primitive local variable itself.

The heap contains all objects created in your Java application, regardless of what thread created the object. This includes the object versions of the primitive types (e.g. Byte, Integer, Long etc.). It does not matter if an object was created and assigned to a local variable, or created as a member variable of another object, the object is still stored on the heap.

Here is a diagram illustrating the call stack and local variables stored on the thread stacks, and objects stored on the heap:

在JVM中运行的每个线程都有自己的线程栈。线程栈包含的信息为：
