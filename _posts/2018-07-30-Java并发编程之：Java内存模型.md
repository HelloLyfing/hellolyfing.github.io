title: Java并发编程之：Java内存模型
---


The Java memory model specifies how the Java virtual machine works with the computer's memory (RAM). The Java virtual machine is a model of a whole computer so this model naturally includes a memory model - AKA the Java memory model.

It is very important to understand the Java memory model if you want to design correctly behaving concurrent programs. The Java memory model specifies how and when different threads can see values written to shared variables by other threads, and how to synchronize access to shared variables when necessary.

The original Java memory model was insufficient, so the Java memory model was revised in Java 1.5. This version of the Java memory model is still in use in Java 8.

前言：Java内存模型详细说明了Java虚拟机(以下将使用JVM这个术语)是如何与计算机的内存(RAM)进行交互的。JVM是一个完整计算机的模型，所以该模型也包含了内存模块，也就是我们熟知的Java内存模型。

想要设计出符合预期的并发程序，了解Java的内存模型是非常重要的。Java内存模型详细描述了不同的线程如何以及何时可以看见被其他线程写入的共享变量，以及在需要时如何同步使用共享变量。

Java内存模型在一开始是不够完善的，不过它在Java 1.5中被改进了。Java8依然在使用这一改进版本的内存模型。

# 一、一窥Java内存模型的内部

The Java memory model used internally in the JVM divides memory between thread stacks and the heap. This diagram illustrates the Java memory model from a logic perspective:

JVM中的Java内存模型将内存分为线程栈(thread stacks)和堆(heap)。下图从逻辑角度演示了Java的内存模型：

Each thread running in the Java virtual machine has its own thread stack. The thread stack contains information about what methods the thread has called to reach the current point of execution. I will refer to this as the "call stack". As the thread executes its code, the call stack changes.

The thread stack also contains all local variables for each method being executed (all methods on the call stack). A thread can only access it's own thread stack. Local variables created by a thread are invisible to all other threads than the thread who created it. Even if two threads are executing the exact same code, the two threads will still create the local variables of that code in each their own thread stack. Thus, each thread has its own version of each local variable.

All local variables of primitive types ( boolean, byte, short, char, int, long, float, double) are fully stored on the thread stack and are thus not visible to other threads. One thread may pass a copy of a pritimive variable to another thread, but it cannot share the primitive local variable itself.

The heap contains all objects created in your Java application, regardless of what thread created the object. This includes the object versions of the primitive types (e.g. Byte, Integer, Long etc.). It does not matter if an object was created and assigned to a local variable, or created as a member variable of another object, the object is still stored on the heap.

Here is a diagram illustrating the call stack and local variables stored on the thread stacks, and objects stored on the heap:

在JVM中运行的每个线程都有自己的线程栈。线程栈包含的信息为：当前方法执行到的点。我将称这个栈为“调用栈”，当线程执行代码时，调用栈也会随之变化。

线程栈还包含了每个被执行的方法（所有位于调用栈的方法）内部的所有局部变量(local variables)。一个线程只能访问自己的线程栈。被一个线程创建的内部变量，对其他线程是不可见的。即便两个线程在执行一模一样的代码，他们仍然会在自己的线程栈中创建局部变量。也就是说，每个线程都有自己的局部变量的版本。

所有原始类型( boolean, byte, short, char, int, long, float, double)的局部变量全部都存储在线程栈中，所以它们对其他线程是不可见的。一个线程可以向其他线程传递原始类型变量的拷贝，但无法共享内部的原始类型变量。

堆则包含了所有Java对象(objects)，无论它们是由哪个线程创建的，这些对象包括对原始类型封装而成的包装类(Integer、Long等)。无论对象是在局部被创建并复制给局部变量，还是作为其他对象的成员被创建的。这些对象始终都位于堆中。

下图展示了线程栈中存储的调用栈和局部变量，以及堆中存储的对象：

A local variable may be of a primitive type, in which case it is totally kept on the thread stack.

A local variable may also be a reference to an object. In that case the reference (the local variable) is stored on the thread stack, but the object itself if stored on the heap.

An object may contain methods and these methods may contain local variables. These local variables are also stored on the thread stack, even if the object the method belongs to is stored on the heap.

An object's member variables are stored on the heap along with the object itself. That is true both when the member variable is of a primitive type, and if it is a reference to an object.

Static class variables are also stored on the heap along with the class definition.

Objects on the heap can be accessed by all threads that have a reference to the object. When a thread has access to an object, it can also get access to that object's member variables. If two threads call a method on the same object at the same time, they will both have access to the object's member variables, but each thread will have its own copy of the local variables.

Here is a diagram illustrating the points above:

一个局部变量如果是原始类型的，则它会存储在线程栈中。

一个局部变量如果是对一个对象的引用，则这个变量的引用会存储在线程栈中，但引用的对象则会存储在堆中。

一个对象的方法以及方法内的局部变量，也是存储在线程栈中，即便这个对象本身存储在堆中。

一个对象的成员变量和对象一样存储在堆中，无论这个成员变量是原始类型还是对对象的引用。此外，静态类变量也是存储在堆中111。

处于堆中的对象，可以被任何拥有其引用的线程访问到。当一个线程访问一个对象时，它也可以访问到对象的成员变量和方法111。如果两个线程在同一时间访问同一个对象的方法，他们可以同时调用该对象的该方法，不过每个线程都会拥有一份方法内的局部变量的拷贝。

下图演示了上面提到的那些点：

![](/images/java_concurrency/java-memory-model-3.png)

Two threads have a set of local variables. One of the local variables (Local Variable 2) point to a shared object on the heap (Object 3). The two threads each have a different reference to the same object. Their references are local variables and are thus stored in each thread's thread stack (on each). The two different references point to the same object on the heap, though.

Notice how the shared object (Object 3) has a reference to Object 2 and Object 4 as member variables (illustrated by the arrows from Object 3 to Object 2 and Object 4). Via these member variable references in Object 3 the two threads can access Object 2 and Object 4.

The diagram also shows a local variable which point to two different objects on the heap. In this case the references point to two different objects (Object 1 and Object 5), not the same object. In theory both threads could access both Object 1 and Object 5, if both threads had references to both objects. But in the diagram above each thread only has a reference to one of the two objects.

So, what kind of Java code could lead to the above memory graph? Well, code as simple as the code below:

两个线程有一组局部变量。其中一个局部变量Local Variable 2指向了位于堆中的对象Object 3。这两个线程的局部变量和引用是不一样的，它们存储在各自的线程栈中，虽然二者指向的同一个对象存储在堆中。

注意对象Object 3的成员变量，分别引用了对象Object 2和对象Object 4（注意图中Object 3指向Object 2和Object 4的箭头），藉由对象Object 3中的成员变量，两个线程也可以访问到对象Object 2和Object 4.

图中也展示了线程栈中的methodTwo()中的局部变量Local Variable 1指向位于堆中的两个不同对象的情况。此时这个引用指向了两个不同的对象（Object 1和Object 5），而不是同一对象。理论上每个线程都可以访问到这两个对象Object 1和Object 5，如果每个线程都有指向这两个对象的引用。但在上图中，每个线程只有一个指向两个对象之一的引用。

那么，用什么样的Java代码可以反推出上面的内存图呢？其实，图例对应的Java代码也很简单：

```
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable() {

    public void run() {
        methodOne();
    }

    public void methodOne() {
        int localVariable1 = 45;

        MySharedObject localVariable2 =
            MySharedObject.sharedInstance;

        //... do more with local variables.

        methodTwo();
    }

    public void methodTwo() {
        Integer localVariable1 = new Integer(99);

        //... do more with local variable.
    }
}
```

```
public class MySharedObject {

    //static variable pointing to instance of MySharedObject

    public static final MySharedObject sharedInstance =
        new MySharedObject();


    //member variables pointing to two objects on the heap

    public Integer object2 = new Integer(22);
    public Integer object4 = new Integer(44);

    public long member1 = 12345;
    public long member1 = 67890;
}
```

If two threads were executing the run() method then the diagram shown earlier would be the outcome. The run() method calls methodOne() and methodOne() calls methodTwo().

methodOne() declares a primitive local variable (localVariable1 of type int) and an local variable which is an object reference (localVariable2).

Each thread executing methodOne() will create its own copy of localVariable1 and localVariable2 on their respective thread stacks. The localVariable1 variables will be completely separated from each other, only living on each thread's thread stack. One thread cannot see what changes another thread makes to its copy of localVariable1.

Each thread executing methodOne() will also create their own copy of localVariable2. However, the two different copies of localVariable2 both end up pointing to the same object on the heap. The code sets localVariable2 to point to an object referenced by a static variable. There is only one copy of a static variable and this copy is stored on the heap. Thus, both of the two copies of localVariable2 end up pointing to the same instance of MySharedObject which the static variable points to. The MySharedObject instance is also stored on the heap. It corresponds to Object 3 in the diagram above.

Notice how the MySharedObject class contains two member variables too. The member variables themselves are stored on the heap along with the object. The two member variables point to two other Integer objects. These Integer objects correspond to Object 2 and Object 4 in the diagram above.

Notice also how methodTwo() creates a local variable named localVariable1. This local variable is an object reference to an Integer object. The method sets the localVariable1 reference to point to a new Integer instance. The localVariable1 reference will be stored in one copy per thread executing methodTwo(). The two Integer objects instantiated will be stored on the heap, but since the method creates a new Integer object every time the method is executed, two threads executing this method will create separate Integer instances. The Integer objects created inside methodTwo() correspond to Object 1 and Object 5 in the diagram above.

Notice also the two member variables in the class MySharedObject of type long which is a primitive type. Since these variables are member variables, they are still stored on the heap along with the object. Only local variables are stored on the thread stack.
